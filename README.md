This is my collection of addons I've created for mitmproxy!!
Look, these aren't the greatest code quality in the world.
They're really designed to make my own life easier, but I'll still share them with the world.
I kinda hate burpsuite but I like mitmproxy.
So, sometimes I hack together addons to expand its capabilities and make it smoother to use other programs
like ffuf by populating it with values from mitmproxy...
But they're quick and dirty. If I find a bug, I might fix it, or I might just live with it if it's not any work to avoid it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

That being said, help yourself!
